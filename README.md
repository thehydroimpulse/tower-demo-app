# Demo Tower.js Application

This is just a demo of using the new Tower.js. It's still in development, and this is what I'm testing on while developing and working on Tower.

I'm currently focusing on getting the server-side infrastructure up-and-running.

## Install

First, install tower.js.

```bash
sudo npm install tower -g
```

This will give you access to the `tower` binary.

Clone this repo:

```bash
git clone ...
cd tower-demo-app
npm install
tower
```

Running `tower` with no arguments will invoke the server. Tower will then (hopefully) be running without any issues.
